This program exists as thought exercise as to how fictional people within the Marvel Cinematic Universe films would track their age in the event of half of all life vanishing on May 31st 2018 to October 17th 2023 in an event known as "The Blip". This is useful for figuring out what ages certain characters are during the events of particular movies. 

Here are some definitions that may be of use when using this program. 

Current Date: As a general rule of thumb, MCU movies usually take place 3 years in the future from their release. That means the "present" in this program is calculated at 3 years ahead of the real life date on your computer.

Legal Age: The number of birthdays Someone has been alive to experience. This means that Blipped people are effectively considered to have missed 5 birthdays. This is simple on paper, but has weird edge cases such as a set of mutually blipped twins born on May 31st and June 1st being a year apart legally despite both being practically the same age. Despite only being a few hours older, one Twin can drive, drink, and vote a full 365 days before the other. 

Biological Age: This is determined by the number of total days one has been alive and as such been able to biologically age. Per the previous example, those twins' biological age would only be 1 day apart rather than 365.

Biological Birthday: This represents the date every year which one's biological age ticks over every year. For example, someone who was born on October 18th 2000 before later being blipped, they would immediately experienced their 18th birthday 137 days "early" from their perspective. The day they biologically reach 6575 days old (March 5th) is their new Biological birthday.

Dating Pool: A very rough rule of thumb is that it's generally socially acceptable for one to be romantically involved in is one where the younger partner to be at an age of at least seven years plus 1/2 the age of the older partner. That becomes a lot more complicated when someone's "age" can no longer be calculated with a single number. This program provides the earliest and latest that a potential partner can have been born depending on whether they were blipped, or spared while still fitting within the general social boundaries.
